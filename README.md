Purpose:

The useFetch custom hook is designed to manage asynchronous data fetching within React components.
Signature:


useFetch(url: string): { data: any[], loading: boolean, error: boolean }

Parameters:

url (String): The URL from which data is to be fetched.

Returns:

An object with the following properties:

data (Array): The fetched data.

loading (Boolean): Indicates whether data is currently being loaded.

error (Boolean): Indicates whether an error occurred during the fetch operation.

React Component: Card

Purpose:

The Card component demonstrates the practical application of the useFetch custom hook. It fetches data and dynamically renders it in a card format.
Dependencies:

React: The React library is required for creating React components.

Usage:

<Card />

Notes:

Ensure the provided URL in the useFetch hook is valid and returns JSON data.

Customize the component UI and error messages to align with specific application requirements.

Assumes a basic familiarity with React and asynchronous JavaScript operations for effective utilization.

This point-by-point breakdown provides a structured overview of the useFetch custom hook and the Card component, covering their purposes, signatures, parameters, returns, dependencies, 

usage, and additional notes. Adjustments can be made as needed for specific project contexts.
